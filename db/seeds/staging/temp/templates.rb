Research data is an NRC asset and must be appropriately catalogued and managed. This is especially true for the NRC COVID-19 data repository which serves as a dynamic, long-term, data driven collaboration platform, enabling access to past as well as current project data.</p>\r\n<p>The COVID-19 Repository DMP Template will take approximately 2 hours to complete. Information in the template can be saved and completed at a later date.</p>\r\n<p>This Data Management Plan template consists of five tabs:</p>\r\n<p>Tab 1 provides the core \"tombstone\" information for your DMP. As you can see, a separate DMP is needed for each project planned. This is true even if some or all of the same data is used in each project. If the project does not include a researcher with an ORCID iD, or a relevant grant number, or funder, you may leave these fields blank.</p>\r\n<p>Tab 2 (this tab) provides you with some information on the template, but does not require you to fill anything in.</p>\r\n<p>Tabs 3 (project initiating data), 4 (collected data), and 5 (derived data) should all be completed, prior to the commencement of the project. Tabs 4 and 5 should also be updated regularly as the project proceeds. If the answers to certain rows are identical for each tab, please cut-and-paste your responses into the other tabs. Please note that the tabs are not identical. Do fill out all tabs and rows.</p>\r\n<p>Once complete, you should save a pdf copy of your DMP and obtain written approval form your Team Lead. Once approved by your Team Lead, you should send the DMP and a copy of the fully executed COVID-19 Repository Data Submission agreement to DT Director R&amp;D Louis Borgeat for approval, prior to commencing your project.</p>\r\n<p>You have requested access to the NRC COVID-19 Data Repository for your research project. This is an ongoing, gated-access shared data repository. As such, it has rules regarding acceptable data, acceptable practices, and access permissions. If you have not already done so, you should contact NRC business management support (BMS) to begin the process of getting the necessary agreements (data submission and repository access) signed by all project collaborators. You will not be permitted to add data or access the repository until these agreements have been fully executed and the Repository Oversight Committee has accepted them. Please note that data requirements, including complete de-identification, must be met and completion of this template does not lessen any Repository requirements relating to incoming data. <br /><br /></p>","published":0,"org_id":39,"locale":"en-CA","is_default":0,"created_at":"2021-08-13 18:49:37 UTC","updated_at":"2021-10-15 01:34:48 UTC","version":0,"visibility":0,"customization_of":null,"family_id":1750773748,"archived":0,"links":"{\"funder\":[],\"sample_plan\":[]}"},{"id":3619,"title":"Portage Template","description":"<p>This is the generic DMP template for Portage.</p>","published":0,"org_id":44,"locale":"en-CA","is_default":0,"created_at":"2021-08-18 14:40:42 UTC","updated_at":"2021-08-18 14:40:42 UTC","version":1,"visibility":0,"customization_of":878086536,"family_id":1133672647,"archived":0,"links":"{\"funder\":[],\"sample_plan\":[]}"},{"id":3620,"title":"Modèle de base Portage - UL","description":"<p>Utilisation du mod&egrave;le de base Portage avec conseils sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; l'Universit&eacute; Laval</p>","published":0,"org_id":44,"locale":"fr-CA","is_default":0,"created_at":"2021-08-18 14:47:58 UTC","updated_at":"2021-09-22 14:22:10 UTC","version":0,"visibility":0,"customization_of":null,"family_id":2006705800,"archived":0,"links":"{\"funder\":[],\"sample_plan\":[]}"},{"id":3621,"title":"Portage Template","description":"<p>This is the generic DMP template for Portage.</p>","published":0,"org_id":13,"locale":"en-CA","is_default":0,"created_at":"2021-08-23 17:12:40 UTC","updated_at":"2021-08-23 17:12:40 UTC","version":2,"visibility":0,"customization_of":878086536,"family_id":542227899,"archived":0,"links":"{\"funder\":[],\"sample_plan\":[]}"},{"id":3622,"title":"Portage Template","description":"<p>This is the generic DMP template for Portage.</p>","published":1,"org_id":14,"locale":"en-CA","is_default":0,"created_at":"2021-09-21 16:39:10 UTC","updated_at":"2021-09-21 16:44:32 UTC","version":2,"visibility":0,"customization_of":878086536,"family_id":1020694319,"archived":0,"links":"{\"funder\":[],\"sample_plan\":[]}"},{"id":3623,"title":"Portage Template","description":"<p>This is the generic DMP template for Portage.</p>","published":0,"org_id":14,"locale":"en-CA","is_default":0,"created_at":"2021-09-27 20:44:22 UTC","updated_at":"2021-09-27 20:44:22 UTC","version":3,"visibility":0,"customization_of":878086536,"family_id":1020694319,"archived":0,"links":"{\"funder\":[],\"sample_plan\":[]}"},{"id":3624,"title":"Portage Template for Advanced Research Computing","description":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ARC provides researchers with digital technology, infrastructure and expertise to help them solve research problems that are either too large or too complex to undertake by other means.

While there are some advantages to working inside the RDC for data management, there is also a substantial drawback: RDC data can never be deposited in a repository in accordance with the recommended best practices for research data management. Because of this, researchers should be mindful of other options to engage in best practices. In addition to ensuring that the RDC project folder is well documented, and consistent with the research output, researchers should curate a supporting data deposit at a recognized repository in their discipline or within the </span><a href=\"https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Federated Research Data Repository</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (FRDR) containing metadata, syntax (code that produces a statistical output), and any other supporting material for the research project.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This template is for researchers who are doing RDC work using Statistics Canada data available in the RDC </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (i.e. there is no supplemental data, public use statistics, or any other information that complements the RDC work).
