The UK Data Archive provides a useful table of file formats for various types of data. Keep in mind that preservation-friendly files converted from one format to another may lose information (e.g. converting from an uncompressed TIFF file to a compressed JPG file), so changes to file formats should be documented. Identify steps required following project completion in order to ensure the data you are choosing to preserve or share is anonymous, error-free, and converted to recommended formats with a minimal risk of data loss.
