  text: "Ensuring Continued Accessibility and Use of Your Digital Outputs"
  guidance: "<p>In this section you must provide information about any plans for ensuring that digital outputs remain sustainable in the sense of immediately accessible and usable beyond the period of funding. There are costs to ensuring sustainability in this sense over and above the costs of preservation. The project's sustainability plan should therefore be proportionate to the envisaged longer-term value of the data for the research community and should be closely related to your plans for dissemination and Pathways to Impact.</p><p>If you believe that digital outputs should not be sustained beyond the period of funding then this should be justified. It is not mandatory to sustain all digital outputs. While you should consider the long-term value of the digital outputs to the research community, where they are purely ancillary to a project’s research outputs there may not be a case for sustaining them (though there would usually be a case for preservation).</p><p>You must consider the sustainability of your digital outputs in five ways: what, where, how, for how long, and how the cost will be covered. You must make appropriate provision for user consultation and user testing in this connection, and plan the development of suitable user documentation.</p><p>You should provide justification if you do not envisage open, public access. A case can be made for charging for or otherwise limiting access, but the default expectation is that access will be open. The Technical Reviewer will be looking for realistic commitments to sustaining public access in line with affordability and the longer-term value of the digital output.</p><p>You must consider any institutional support needed in order to carry out these plans, if not covered under Section 3, as well as the cost of keeping the digital output publicly available in the future, including issues relating to maintenance, infrastructure and upgrade (such as the need to modify aspects of a web interface or software application in order to account for changes in the technological environments). In order to minimise sustainability costs, it is generally useful that the expertise involved in the development of your project is supported by expertise in your own or a partner institution.</p><p>A sustainability plan does not necessarily mean a requirement to generate income or prevent resources from being freely available. Rather it is a requirement to consider the direct costs and expertise of maintaining digital outputs for continued access. Some applicants might be able to demonstrate that there will be no significant sustainability problems with their digital output; in some cases the university’s computing services or library might provide a firm commitment to sustaining the resource for a specified period; others might see the benefit of Open Source community development models. You should provide reassurances of sustainability which are proportionate to the envisaged longer-term value of the digital outputs for the research community.</p><p>When completing this section, you should consider the potential impact of the data on research in your field (if research in the discipline will be improved through the creation of the digital output, how will it be affected if the resource then disappears?), and make the necessary connections with your Impact Plan. You must factor in the effects of any IP, copyright and ethical issues during the period in which the digital output will be publicly accessible, connecting what you say with the relevant part of your Case for Support.</p><p>You must identify whether or not you envisage the academic content (as distinct from the technology) of the digital output being extended or updated beyond the period of funding, addressing the following issues: how this will be done, by who and at what cost. You will need to show how the cost of this will be sustained after the period of funding ends.</p>"

Applicants should consider where, how, and to whom their data should be made available.</p><p>In addition, data sharing practices will change as areas of research develop and become more mature. This can be observed by looking at the areas of sequencing (i.e. well established mechanisms in place), microarrays (i.e. standards developed and being implemented) and systems biology (i.e. databases currently not well developed). Consideration should be given to what constitutes good practice in emerging areas of research.</p><p>It is expected that data sharing strategies will fall into the two broad categories below.</p><p class='guidance_header'>Data Sharing via a 3rd Party</p><p>Data sharing via deposition in an existing database, repository or other community resource is expected where possible and researchers are encouraged to share data through mechanisms affording the widest availability for generating added value and enabling re-use.</p><p>Researchers are encouraged to use existing infrastructure to facilitate data sharing where possible.

Researchers are expected to ensure that data are maintained for a period of 10 years after the completion of the research project in suitable accessible formats using established standards where possible such that the data can be made available on request in line with BBSRC guidance on good scientific practice. This may lead to collaboration between the new user and the original data creators, with the responsibilities and rights of all parties agreed at the outset.</p><p>Other mechanisms for data sharing may be used where appropriate.

BBSRC is also driving a policy of Knowledge Transfer and strongly encourages the commercialisation of IP through various initiatives. BBSRC recognises the need for periods of exclusive use of data but considers that commercialisation of research does not preclude data sharing and should not unduly delay or prevent data sharing. Any IP issues or plans for commercialisation should be highlighted in the case for support of the grant application. </li><li><strong>Length or scope of research project:</strong> Data from large studies may be released in waves as they become available or as they are published.</li></ul></p>"

To enable this, applicants are encouraged to include with the dataset all the necessary information (metadata) describing the data and their format. This information should include such information as the methodology used to collect data, definitions of variables, units of measurement, any assumptions made, the format of the data, file type of the data etc. To support this researchers are strongly encouraged to utilise community standards to describe and structure data, (e.g. common terminology, minimum information guidelines and standard data exchange formats).</p>"

  guidance: "<p>As the value of data is often dependent on its timeliness Cancer Research UK expects that data sharing should occur in a timely manner. Cancer Research UK acknowledges that the investigators who generated the data have a legitimate interest in benefiting from their investment of time and effort and we therefore support the initial investigator having a reasonable period of private use of the data but not prolonged exclusive use. </p><p>Cancer Research UK expects data to be released no later than the acceptance for publication of the main findings from the final dataset (unless restrictions from third party agreements or IP protection still apply) or on a timescale in line with the procedures of the relevant research area. For example, for crystallography data there is an agreed 12-month delay between publishing the first paper on a structure and making the co-ordinates public. </p><p>With experiments carried out over an extended period of time, (e.g. population based studies), it is reasonable to expect that subsets of data analysed by the investigator(s) be made available for sharing. The investigator(s) can then continue to benefit from further reasonable periods of exclusive analysis while the dataset as a whole matures.</p>"

  guidance: "<p class='guidance_header'>Data Sharing Agreements</p> <p>To ensure that data are used appropriately investigators may consider implementing a data sharing agreement that indicates the criteria for data access and conditions for research use. This can ensure the responsibilities of both parties, along with intellectual property, citation and publication rights are agreed at the outset. It may incorporate privacy and confidentiality standards, as needed, to ensure data security at the recipient site and prohibit manipulation of data. For further guidance on managing data access and the development of data sharing agreements please refer to the 'Samples and Data for Cancer Research: Template for Access Policy Development' document available from the NCRI website. </p><p class='guidance_header'>Data Acknowledgement</p> <p>As a minimum, researchers using shared data are expected to acknowledge the investigators who generated the data upon which any published findings are based. When both parties have collaborated using a shared dataset, co-authorship on publications may be more appropriate. Researchers using shared data are also expected to acknowledge Cancer Research UK for supporting the original study.</p>"

  text: "Any reasons why there may be restrictions on data sharing?"
  guidance: "<p>Data which might have the potential to be exploited commercially or otherwise to deliver patient benefit should be discussed with your technology transfer office and Cancer Research Technology prior to data sharing. Cancer Research UK encourages the appropriate filing of patents and recognises that there may be a need to delay the release of data until patent applications have been filed. Whilst there may be a delay in the release of data due to the application process, appropriate intellectual property protection should not hinder data sharing and may be the best way of ensuring that patient (and public) benefit is delivered. Any intellectual property issues or plans for commercialisation that may affect data sharing should be addressed in the data sharing plan. Cancer Research UK understands that unexpected intellectual property may arise during the course of the study and investigators may need to depart from their data sharing plan to protect intellectual property and for any other necessary steps to be taken. Data sharing may also be affected when co-funding is provided by the private sector (e.g. by a pharmaceutical company) or host institution resulting in some restrictions on the disclosure of data. For example with clinical trials, the Trial Management Group and/or trial sponsor etc may impose restrictions on data access. Any restrictions should be outlined in the data sharing plan and applicants should explore ways data sharing requests can be considered by the body that owns the data.</p> <p class='guidance_header'>e.g. Development arrangements through Cancer Research Technology including intellectual property protection and commercialisation</p> <p class='guidance_header'>e.g. Proprietary Data - restrictions due to collaborations with for profit organisations International policies governing the sharing of data collected outside of the UK</p> <p>My research seeks supports from both the public and private sectors. How do I deal with the sharing of data? Where research is funded by a commercial sponsor, restrictions on data sharing may apply in arrangements agreed with the sponsor. Any such restriction(s) should be highlighted in the data management and sharing plan. In the event that researchers apply for or receive commercial funding for any part of their research that Cancer Research UK supports they should advise Cancer Research Technology of the situation without delay.</p> <p class='guidance_header'>e.g. Confidentiality, ethical or consent issues that may arise with the use of data involving human subjects.</p> <p>Investigators carrying out research involving human participants must ensure that consent is obtained to share information; furthermore the necessary legal, ethical and regulatory permissions regarding data sharing should be in place prior to disclosing any data. Every effort must be made to protect the identity of participants and, prior to sharing, data should be anonymised. In addition, any indirect identifiers that may lead to deductive disclosures should be removed to reduce the risk of identification. In most instances, sharing data should be possible without compromising the confidentiality of participants but if there are circumstances where data needs to be restricted due to the inability to protect confidentiality this should be fully addressed in the data management and sharing plan.</p>"

  guidance: "<p>Researchers should maximise access to research datasets of value to the wider research community in a timely and responsible manner.

However, if your research meets the criteria for requiring a data management and sharing plan but you are intending not to share your data, the reasons for this must be clearly justified. </p><p>Data should be shared in accordance with recognised data standards where these exist, and in a way that maximises opportunities for data linkage and interoperability. Sufficient metadata must be provided to enable the dataset to be used by others. Agreed best practice standards for metadata provision should be adopted where these are in place. </p><p>When developing data management and sharing plans, researchers should therefore consider and briefly describe: <ul> <li>what types of data the proposed research will generate? </li><li>which data will have value to other research users and could be shared? </li><li>what data formats and quality standards will be applied to enable the data to be shared effectively?</li></ul></p>"

  guidance: "<p>Data should be made available to other researchers with as few restrictions as possible. Where a managed access process is required - for example, where a study involves potentially identifiable data about research participants - the access mechanisms established should be proportionate to the risks associated with the data, and must not unduly restrict or delay access. Any managed access procedures that are proposed must be described clearly as part of your data management and sharing plan. </p><p>Depending on the study, it may be appropriate to establish a graded access procedure in which less sensitive data (e.g. anonymised and aggregate data) are made readily available, whereas applications to access to more sensitive datasets are subject to a more stringent assessment process. </p><p>Any managed access procedures should be consistent and transparent. In cases where a Data Access Committee is required to assess applications to access data, the composition of such Committees should include individuals with appropriate expertise who are independent of the project. </p><p>Where appropriate, the Trust would encourage those generating datasets that are likely to be of significant value to other researchers to publish a 'marker paper' or other form of publication, which enables data users to formally cite their usage of the resource. </p><p>Where a database resource is being developed as part of a funded activity, researchers should take reasonable steps to ensure that potential users are made aware of its availability.
