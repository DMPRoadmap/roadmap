        The <strong>DMP Assistant</strong> is a national, online, bilingual data management planning tool developed by the <strong>Portage Network</strong> in collaboration with host institution <strong>University of Alberta</strong> to assist researchers in preparing <strong>data management plans (DMPs)</strong>. This tool is freely available to all researchers, and develops a DMP through a series of key data management questions, supported by best-practice guidance and examples.
      </p>

      <p>
        DMPs are one of the foundations of good research data management (RDM), an international best practice, and increasingly required by institutions and funders. For example, they are a pillar of the <a href='http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html'>Canadian Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy</a>.
