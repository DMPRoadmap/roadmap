<%# locals: { f, question, answer, locking } %>
<%# 
  When locking variable is true, this partial renders a plain paragraph with the question answer or default value instead.
  Since the partial answers/_locking reuses the partial answers/_new_edit which reuses this partial within, when a stale answer is found
  the browser renders two forms (first the stale answer form followed by the latest answer saved). This reusability comes with a side-effect,
  i.e. the browser might end up with duplicate ids for the form controls and therefore re-loading tinymce for the locking form becomes
  rather cumbersome. As such, this workaround, simplifies the logic when a stale answer is found by rendering the html of the answer directly
  within a paragraph.
