### <%= _('What is the DMPTool?') %>

<%= _("The DMPTool is a free, open-source, online application that helps researchers create data management plans. These plans, or DMPs, are now required by many funding agencies as part of the grant proposal submission process. The DMPTool provides a click-through wizard for creating a DMP that complies with funder requirements. It also has direct links to funder websites, help text for answering questions, and resources for best practices surrounding data management.") %>

### <%= _('DMPTool Background') %>
         
<%= _("The original DMPTool was a grassroots effort, beginning in 2011 with eight institutions partnering to provide in-kind contributions of personnel and development. The effort was in direct response to demands from funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, that researchers plan for managing their research data. By joining forces the contributing institutions were able to consolidate expertise and reduce costs in addressing data management needs.") %>

<%= raw _("The original contributing institutions were: <a href=\"https://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/\" target=\"_blank\">University of California Curation Center (UC3)</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.cdlib.org/\" target=\"_blank\">California Digital Library</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dataone.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DataONE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dcc.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Curation Centre (DCC-UK)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Institution</a>, <a href=\"https://www.library.ucla.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of California, Los Angeles Library</a>, <a href=\"https://libraries.ucsd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of California, San Diego Libraries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.library.illinois.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Library</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.library.virginia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Virginia Library</a>.") %>

<%= raw _("Given the success of the first version of the DMPTool, the founding partners obtained funding from the <a href=\"https://sloan.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> to create a second version of the tool, released in 2014.") %>

<%= _("Since then the proliferation of open data policies across the globe led to an explosion of interest in the DMPTool and the UK-based version, DMPonline. In 2016 UC3 and DCC decided to formalize our partnership to codevelop and maintain a single open-source platform. The new platform—DMPRoadmap—is separate from the services each of our teams runs on top of it. By providing a core infrastructure for DMPs we can extend our reach and move best practices forward, allowing us to participate in a truly global open science ecosystem.") %>

<%= _("Future enhancements will focus on making DMPs machine actionable so please continue sharing your use cases.

### <%= _('How to Participate in the DMPTool') %>

<%= _("DMPTool participants are institutions, profit and nonprofit organizations, individuals, or other groups that leverage the DMPTool as an effective and efficient way to create data management plans. Our community of participating organizations helps to sustain and support the DMPTool in the following ways:    
- Establish institutional authentication with the DMPTool (Shibboleth)     
- Customize the tool with resources, help text, suggested answers, or other information    
- Contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of the DMPTool codebase   
- Help ensure that the DMPTool maintains its relevance and utility by notifying the DMPTool Helpdesk if:   
    - Funders release new requirements that are not reflected in the tool      
    - Errors, mistakes, or misinformation are discovered in the tool      
    - The tool's functionality is compromised (i.e., slow response times, poor performance, or software bugs)   ") %>

<%= _("See a <a href=\"https://dmptool-stg.cdlib.org/public_orgs" target=\"_blank\">current list</a> of DMPTool participants.") %>

### <%= _('DMPTool Principles') %>
<%= _("Our work on the DMPTool is guided by the principles below. Organizations that participate in the DMPTool community are expected to understand and abide by these principles.   
- Continuous improvement of the DMPTool's utility and features
- User-driven requirements and priorities for development
- Enthusiasm for the DMPTool
