    tab_1: "Background"
    tab_2: "Latest news"

    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>Funding bodies increasingly require their grant-holders to produce Data Management Plans(DMP), both during the bid-preparation stage and after funding has been secured. DMPonline has been produced by the UK's Digital Curation Centre to help research teams respond to this requirement, and any expectations that their institution or others may apply.</p>
    <p>The <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>DCC</a> has worked closely with research funders and universities to produce a tool that assists researchers to produce an effective data management plan (DMP) to cater for the whole lifecycle of a project, from bid-preparation stage through to completion.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <p>There are a number of templates within the tool that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions. Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by researcher funders, universities and disciplines.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>If you have an account please sign in and start creating or editing your DMP.</p>
    <p>If you do not have a DMPonline account, click on <a href='/'>'Sign up'</a> on the homepage.</p>
    <p>Please visit the <a href='/help'>'Help'</a> page for guidance.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
    <p>We are constantly improving the user interface and functionality of DMPonline.
    If you would like to contribute with feedback and suggestions, please contact us by emailing
    <a href='mailto:dmponline@dcc.ac.uk?Subject=DMPonline%20inquiry' target='_top'>dmponline@dcc.ac.uk</a>. You can also report bugs and request new features directly on <a href='https://github.com/DigitalCurationCentre/DMPonline_v4' target='_top'>GitHub</a></p>

    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>The DCC is collaborating with the DMPTool team to develop a joint codebase for Data Management Planning called <a href='https://github.com/DMPRoadmap' target='_blank	'>DMP Roadmap</a>. Both of our tools will be delivered using this in the future. We've agreed what features need to be included and are planning a few sprints to deliver these. The initial release will include all of the main priorities we already had flagged, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- APIs to create plans, extract guidance and generate statistics from DMPonline</li>
        <li>- Multi-lingual support so foreign language versions can be presented</li>
        <li>- Locales to provide a refined set of content for particular countries or other contexts</li>
        <li>- A lifecycle to indicate the status of DMPs and allow institutional access to plans</li>
        <li>- Support for reviewing Data Management Plans</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DMPonline has an active and growing user base, and we are grateful to the members who suggest ideas for new and improved features. If you would like to help shape our future plans, please join the <a href='https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DMPONLINE-USER-GROUP' target='_blank'>user group</a>.

    body_text_tab_2_html: "<p>DMPonline is developed and maintained by the UK Digital Curation Centre. We’re a small team, and are happy to collaborate with others. There are various ways you can get involved:</p>
    <h3>Join the user group</h3>
    <p>We run a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DMPONLINE-USER-GROUP'>listserv</a> for the DMPonline user group that you can request to join. We also host periodic meetings to consult on our plans. Being part of the user group gives you the opportunity to be informed about future developments and to provide feedback to help shape our plans.</p>
    <p>Our user group sessions are usually focused around a certain topic (e.g. fleshing out use cases for an API) so invites are sent based on your areas of expertise. It is helpful for us to know your role and interests to invite relevant people to each session. Please introduce yourself on the list and share your ideas.</p>
	<p>Notes from previous user group sessions are provided below:</p>

    <h3>Customise DMPonline</h3>
    <p>DMPonline can be customised by institutions and disciplines. You can add templates for users in your organisation and tailored guidance that explains local support and services. Example answers can also be offered to help users understand what to write in a Data Management Plan. To do this you’ll need to request admin access, so please email us on <a href='mailto:dmponline@dcc.ac.uk?Subject=DMPonline%20Admin%20access' target='_top'>dmponline@dcc.ac.uk</a>.</p>
    <p>Futher guidance on customising DMPonline is available on the <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk/dmponline' target='_blank'>DCC website</a>.</p>
