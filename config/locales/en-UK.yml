    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>Funding bodies increasingly require their grant-holders to produce Data Management Plans(DMP), both during the bid-preparation stage and after funding has been secured. %{application_name} has been produced by the %{organisation_name} to help research teams respond to this requirement, and any expectations that their institution or others may apply.</p>
    <p>The %{organisation_abbreviation} worked closely with research funders and universities to produce a tool that assists researchers to produce an effective data management plan (DMP) to cater for the whole lifecycle of a project, from bid-preparation stage through to completion.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <p>There are a number of templates within the tool that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions. Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by researcher funders, universities and disciplines.</p>
    </br>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <p>Please visit the <a href='/help'>'Help'</a> page for guidance.</p>

    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>The %{organisation_abbreviation} are now collaborating to develop a joint codebase for Data Management Planning called <a href='https://github.com/DMPRoadmap' target='_blank	'>DMP Roadmap</a>. Both of our tools will be delivered using this in the future. We've agreed what features need to be included and are planning a few sprints to deliver these. The initial release will include all of the main priorities we already had flagged, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- APIs to create plans, extract guidance and generate statistics from %{application_name}</li>
        <li>- Multi-lingual support so foreign language versions can be presented</li>
        <li>- Locales to provide a refined set of content for particular countries or other contexts</li>
        <li>- A lifecycle to indicate the status of DMPs and allow institutional access to plans</li>
        <li>- Support for reviewing Data Management Plans</li>
    </ul>
    <p>%{application_name} has an active and growing user base, and we are grateful to the members who suggest ideas for new and improved features. If you would like to help shape our future plans, please join the <a href='%{organisation_email}' target='_blank'>user group</a>. More information on how you can engage with us is available under the 'Get involved' tab.</p>

    <h3>Join the user group</h3>
    <p>We run a <a target='_blank' href='%{application_user_group_subscription_url}'>listserv</a> for the %{application_name} user group that you can request to join. We also host periodic meetings to consult on our plans. Being part of the user group gives you the opportunity to be informed about future developments and to provide feedback to help shape our plans.</p>
    <p>Our user group sessions are usually focused around a certain topic (e.g. fleshing out use cases for an API) so invites are sent based on your areas of expertise. It is helpful for us to know your role and interests to invite relevant people to each session. Please introduce yourself on the list and share your ideas.</p>
	<p>Notes from previous user group sessions are provided below:</p>
