msgid "The original DMPTool was a grassroots effort, beginning in 2011 with eight institutions partnering to provide in-kind contributions of personnel and development. The effort was in direct response to demands from funding agencies, such as the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, that researchers plan for managing their research data. By joining forces the contributing institutions were able to consolidate expertise and reduce costs in addressing data management needs. Representatives from these institutions participate on the <a href=\"%{steering_committee_url}\">DMPTool Steering Committee</a> that maintains monthly calls."
