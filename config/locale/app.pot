msgid "<p>%{application_name} is developed and maintained by the UK %{organisation_name}. We’re a small team, and are happy to collaborate with others. There are various ways you can get involved:</p> <h3>Join the user group</h3> <p>We run a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=DMPONLINE-USER-GROUP'>listserv</a> for the %{application_name} user group that you can request to join. We also host periodic meetings to consult on our plans. Being part of the user group gives you the opportunity to be informed about future developments and to provide feedback to help shape our plans.</p> <p>Our user group sessions are usually focused around a certain topic (e.g. fleshing out use cases for an API) so invites are sent based on your areas of expertise. It is helpful for us to know your role and interests to invite relevant people to each session. Please introduce yourself on the list and share your ideas.</p> <p>Notes from previous user group sessions are provided below:</p> <ul> <li>- <a href='/files/DMPonline-user-group-IDCC-2016.pdf' target='_blank'>Meeting notes covering internationalisation and locales, 23 February 2016</a></li> <li>- <a href='/files/DMPonline-user-group-notes-29Jan2015' target='_blank'>Meeting notes covering plan lifecycle and review, 29 January 2015</a></li> </ul> <p>Please let us know your interests and share your ideas for future developments via the mailing list so the community as a whole can feedback on them.</p> </br> <h3>Customise %{application_name}</h3> <p>%{application_name} can be customised by institutions and disciplines. You can add templates for users in your organisation and tailored guidance that explains local support and services. Example answers can also be offered to help users understand what to write in a Data Management Plan. To do this you’ll need to request admin access, so please email us on <a href='mailto:dmponline@dcc.ac.uk?Subject=%{application_name} Admin access' target='_top'>dmponline@dcc.ac.uk</a>.</p> <p>Futher guidance on customising %{application_name} is available on the <a href='%{organisation_url}' target='_blank'>%{application_name} website</a>.</p> </br> <h3>Contribute to the code</h3> <p>%{application_name} is a Ruby on Rails application. The <a href='https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap'>source code</a> is made available under an <a href='https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap/blob/master/LICENSE.md'>MIT License</a>. This permits others to reuse the code freely, but obligates you to share the source code for any extensions in the same way. Please inform us if you install an instance of %{application_name} and offer your contributions back to the community.</p> <p>If you install an instance of %{application_name} we require that you credit the %{organisation_abbreviation} as originators of the tool. We recommend that the acknowledgement takes the form of the %{application_name} logo with a link back to the %{organisation_abbreviation}-hosted version of the tool.</p> <p>We are willing to work with external developers to add new features to the tool. We are also open to delivering new features on a chargeable basis. If there are extensions you would like to see prioritised and have resource to support additional developer effort, please contact us on dmponline@dcc.ac.uk to negotiate terms.</p> <p>The code is available on <a target='_blank' href='%{application_url}'>GitHub</a></p> <h3>Support our work</h3> <p>We are impressed by the uptake of %{application_name} both in the UK and internationally and are really keen to hear  how you are using the tool and promoting it in your context. We are aware that others have run training courses, developed guidance materials and advocated use of the tool. Please notify us of this as it helps to show impact.</p> <p>We are currently investigating options for revenue generation. This will help us serve the increased demand more effectively and safeguard the long-term sustainability of %{application_name}.

Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions.
