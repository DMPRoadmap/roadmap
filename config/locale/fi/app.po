"            <li>'Project Details' includes basic administrative details.</"
"li>\n"
"            <li>Plan Overview’ tells you what template and guidance your "
"plan is based on and gives you an overview to the questions that you will be "
"asked.</li> \n"
"            <li>The following tab(s) present the questions to answer. There "

"\n"
"          <p>Guidance is displayed in the right-hand panel. If you need more "
