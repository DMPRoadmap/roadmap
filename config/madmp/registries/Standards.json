        "description": "The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) metadata standard was originally developed for the earth, environmental and ecological sciences. It is based on prior work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated efforts. It has been developed to document any research data, and as such can be used outside of these original subject areas. EML is implemented as a series of XML document types that can by used in a modular and extensible manner to document ecological data. Each EML module is designed to describe one logical part of the total metadata that should be included with any ecological dataset.",

        "description": "DICOM \u2014 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine \u2014 is the international standard for medical images and related information (ISO 12052). It defines the formats for medical images that can be exchanged with the data and quality necessary for clinical use. DICOM is implemented in almost every radiology, cardiology imaging, and radiotherapy device (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.), and increasingly in devices in other medical domains such as ophthalmology and dentistry. With tens of thousands of imaging devices in use, DICOM is one of the most widely deployed healthcare messaging standards in the world. There are literally billions of DICOM images currently in use for clinical care. Since its first publication in 1993, DICOM has revolutionized the practice of radiology, allowing the replacement of X-ray film with a fully digital workflow. Much as the Internet has become the platform for new consumer information applications, DICOM has enabled advanced medical imaging applications that have \u201cchanged the face of clinical medicine\u201d. From the emergency department, to cardiac stress testing, to breast cancer detection, DICOM is the standard that makes medical imaging work \u2014 for doctors and for patients",
