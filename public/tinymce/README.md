# README

I've added this file here because I was unable to configure the asset pipeleine to work well with Webpacker for loading this stylesheet theme.

In production mode, these CSS files would be given digest extensions, which TinyMCE would not recognise.

If someone can think of a better approach here, please feel free to reconfigure and remove this dir.
