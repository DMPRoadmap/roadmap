## Overview

The DMP Assistant is a national, online, bilingual data management planning tool developed by <a href="https://alliancecan.ca">the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance)</a> in collaboration with host institution University of Alberta to assist researchers in preparing data management plans (DMPs). This tool is freely available to all researchers, and develops a DMP through a series of key data management questions, supported by best-practice guidance and examples.

The DMP Assistant was adapted from the <a href="https://dcc.ac.uk/">Digital Curation Centre (DCC)</a>â€™s <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/">DMPonline</a> tool, and uses the <a href="https://github.com/DMPRoadmap/roadmap">DMP Roadmap codebase</a> developed by DCC and <a href="https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/%20https://cdlib.org/services/uc3/">the University of California Curation Center (UC3)</a>.
