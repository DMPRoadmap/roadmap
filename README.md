## DMP Roadmap

DMP Roadmap is a Data Management Planning tool. It allows users to create data management plans for the projects using funder specific templates and institutional guidance. Once a plan has been completed it can be downloaded and inserted into your grant proposals.

Management and development of the DMP Roadmap is jointly provided by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), http://www.dcc.ac.uk/, and the University of California Curation Center (UC3), http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/

The tool has four main functions
1. To help create and maintain different versions of Data Management Plans;
2. To provide useful guidance on data management issues and how to meet research funders' requirements;
3. To export attractive and useful plans in a variety of formats;
4. To allow collaborative work when creating Data Management Plans.

#### Current Release

#### Pre-requisites
Roadmap is a Ruby on Rails application and you will need to have: 
1. Ruby >= 2.0.0p247
2. Rails >= 4.0
3. MySql >= 5.0

Further details on how to install Ruby on Rails applications are available from the Ruby on Rails site: http://rubyonrails.org

Further details on how to install MySQL and create your first user and database. Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular environment. 
* Install: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
* 
* Create a user: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-user.html
* Create the database: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/creating-database.html

You may also find the following resources handy:

* The Getting Started Guide: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
* Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book: http://www.railstutorial.org/

#### Installation
* Create your mysql db. Select UTF-8 Unicode (utf8mb4) encoding.
* Fork the repository and then clone it onto your server

>     > git clone https://github.com/[your organization]/roadmap.git

>     > cd roadmap

* Make copies of the yaml configuration files and update the values for your installation

>     > cp config/database_example.yml config/database.yml
>     > cp config/secrets_example.yml config/secrets.yml

* Create an environment variable for your instance's secret (as defined in config/secrets.yml). You should use the following command to generate secrets for each of your environments, storing the production one in the environment variable:

>     > rake secret

* Run bundler and perform the DB migrations

>     > gem install bundler (if bundler is not yet installed)

>     > bundle install

>     > rake db:migrate

>     > rake db:seed

* Setup the devise authentication gem

>     > rails generate devise:install     (Is this really necessary?)

* Start the application

>     > rails server

* Verify that the site is running properly by going to http://localhost:3000
* Login as the default administrator: 'super_admin@example.com' - 'password1'

#### Troubleshooting
##### Installation - OSX:

```
An error occurred while installing libv8 (3.11.8.17), and Bundler cannot continue.

Make sure that `gem install libv8 -v '3.11.8.17'` succeeds before bundling. 
```

If you are installing on a system that already has v8 installed then you may need to install the libv8 gem manually using your system's current v8 engine. If you're using homebrew to manage your packages you should run 'brew update' and 'brew upgrade' to make sure you have the latest packages

>     > gem uninstall -a libv8

>     > gem install libv8 -v '<<VERSION>>' -- --with-system-v8

>     > bundle install
